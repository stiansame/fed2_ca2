## Goal

To apply knowledge of JavaScript techniques to implement the front-end functionality for a social media application.

## Brief

You have been tasked with producing a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform. The client application must be attractive and responsive, but you have an otherwise blank slate in terms of theme design language.

Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.

Social API routes require both a JWT token and an API Key. You will need to register an account and login to access your token. To create an API Key, follow the documentation here.


To complete the required features, you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

You must use JSDocs to document at least one function. The minimum requirement is one example of well written JSDocs for a function that includes argument types, return types, a description and a usage example. If you have remaining time before delivery, you should use this to document all of your remaining functions.

Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

A finished project fulfils the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface.
