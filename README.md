# NOROFF FED2 CA1 CSS FRAMEWORKS

![image](https://github.com/stiansame/fed2_ca1/blob/css_frameworks/gitImg.jpg?raw=true)

## Goal

To apply knowledge of Tailwind or Bootstrap and SASS to build a responsive front end for a social media application.

## Brief

You are tasked with creating 3 pages in HTML using Tailwind or Bootstrap and SASS:

Authentication page (/index.html)
Feed Page (/feed/index.html)
Profile page (/profile/index.html)
The authentication page should have a form to login to or register with the application. Be sure to include HTML form validation and use /profile as the form action attribute. The password must have a minimum length of 8 characters.

The feed page should have a list of posts thumbnails, a search bar, sort options and a form to create a new post. You may add additional UI elements beyond these requirements.

The profile page should have a profile image, username, list of user posts, follow button and an area to display following/followers.

There is no requirement for JS functionality beyond things like making sure the mobile menu works.

Create a new repo and perform all your work on a branch called css-frameworks.

Ensure package.json includes a development script that uses tools like watch for real-time updates, and a deployment script for building the production-ready code.

Submi a PR from your css-frameworks branch to the original branch (main/master).
